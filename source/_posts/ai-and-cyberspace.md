"A great design appears at first insane; \
But chance will soon seem quaint and blind, \
And such an exemplary thinking brain \
Will soon by thinkers be designed" \
_- Goethe, 'Faust'_

Also: [What is intelligence?](https://intelligence.org/2013/06/19/what-is-intelligence-2/) Luke Muehlhauser on intelligence as optimization power divided by resources used. 
*   [The Artificial Intelligence Revolution ](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html)-  Wait But Why. Introductory post summarizing the potential dangers of Artificial General Intelligence  
*   [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.de/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111) - e-book by Nick Bostrom. Classic on Superintelligence, that explores different take-off scenarios of AI, why they're dangerous and urges for preparatory action now.
*   [That Alien Message](http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/) - Eliezer Yudkowsky. Challenges mainstream human intuitions on speed of AI.
*   [Sam Harris & Eliezer Yudkowsky ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaNLX71Hl88&t=6011s)- good intro on common problems in AI safety

**Progress & Speed**



*   [Slow Takeoff vs Fast Takeoff](https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/) - Paul Christiano
*   [The AI Foom Debate between Yudkowsky & Hanson](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_Hanson-Yudkowsky_AI-Foom_Debate). Hard or slow take off? Also as video here: [Yudkowsky vs Hanson: Singularity Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuXl-iidnFY). As background: [Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics ](https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf)- Eliezer Yudkowsky. Suggests a methods to test whether a sufficiently advanced machine intelligence could build a smarter version of itself, 
*   which could in turn build an even smarter version, and that this process could continue to the point of vastly surpassing human capability.

Risks 



*   [Malicious Use of AI Report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/3d82daa4-97fe-4096-9c6b-376b92c619de/downloads/1c6q2kc4v_50335.pdf) Miles Brundage and many other authors

Also: [Basic AI drives](https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf) - Steve Omohundro. sufficiently advanced AI systems of any design would, by default, have incentives to pursue a number of instrumentally useful subgoals, such as acquiring more computing power and amassing many resources, which are harmful even if the overarching goals are not.
